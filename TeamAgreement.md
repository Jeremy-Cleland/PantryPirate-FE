Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.
Describe at least:
    What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
    Joe: Calm, committed to finding solutions, flexible
    Jordan: Adaptability, creativity, innovative
    Adrienne: Flexibility, determination, organization, eagerness to learn
    Steve: Organization, determination
    Jeremy: Openness, creativity
How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project? 
    We are all determined and committed to creating a comprehensive, well thought out and organized project that we're proud to include on our resumes. 
In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength? 
    Jordan: The ability to talk about the code more confidently
    Adrienne: Handling ambiguity, ability to talk more confidently about the code, and the craft    competency.. also getting better at reading the docs
    Steve: Technical competency, ability to talk more confidently about the code
    Joe: Planning and estimating
    Jeremy: Craft competency
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
    We will plan to meet each day during the regular class hours, start with a "stand-up" and discuss our questions, concerns and ideas. We will then go through the code thus far and make sure everyone is on the same page. Then we will determine the plan for the day and who will tackle what pieces.
NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
Describe at least:
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises? 
    Create a safe space that cultivates an environment where everyone feels comfortable expressing their concerns or frustrations so that when they arise, we're able to efficiently and effectively talk through them and come to a resolution. If we are unable to resolve it within our group, we will then bring Ryan in to help us discuss possible solutions
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? 
    We will speak up and each advocate for our input to be heard. If need be, we will discuss the issue with Ryan and have him help us address it.
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
     For those that are at lower levels of understanding, it will be important to speak up and ask questions and be intentional about getting involved in the code as the driver. For those that are at a higher level, it will be important to be patient and allow opportunities for everyone to contribute and take the time needed to understand what is happening with the code.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    - Continually offer opportunities to provide input or to drive with the code
    - Reiterate to the individual that we definitely want everyone to have the chance to  contribute
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
      If attempts are unsuccessful, ask Ryan for input in suggestions on how we could better approach the individual and encourage them to get their particiPANTS on.

Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
Describe at least:
What hours will you be available to communicate? 
    We will all plan to be available 9-5pm
What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? 
    Slack
How often will you take breaks? 
    Every hour
What is your plan if you start to fall behind? 
    Put in the extra time to get caught up
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend? 
    Via slack
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
    Give everyone a chance to speak up during our morning stand-ups but then also try to cultivate an environment in general throughout the week where people are able to be heard when attempting to speak up
How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? 
    By listening and asking people directly if they have any input

Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
Describe at least:
How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? 
    We will discuss it each morning and at the end of the day and plan to do some mob program as well as breaking off and doing pair programming or potentially individual, if needed.
What project management tool will be used? 
    Invision or miro to come up with our UML's and daily flow and also potentially Github's project management feature within the repos

Git Process
    Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
Describe at least:
What components of your project will live on GitHub? Our repos

How will you share the repository with your teammates? Creating an organization

What is your Git flow? Create a dev branch and require two approvals before merging to main

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

How many people must review a PR? 2

Who merges PRs? Whoever, once it's approved by the team

How often will you merge? Daily

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? Discuss it with the team beforehand
